# Kidnapped Vehicle Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project I implemented an Two-dimensional Particle Filter to complete the final project for the Localization course. 

This Particle Filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step filter will also get observation and control data.

I use 100 particles.

My **Error = [x:.116, y:.107, yaw:.004]** and this result allows to pass the test successfully.
